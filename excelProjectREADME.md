Bike Sales Analysis

In this project, my aim was to analyze bike sales data and gain insights into the various factors that influence customers' purchase decisions. To achieve this, I utilized Excel to create pivot tables, allowing me to examine the relationships between different factors like income, gender, education, marital status, regions, and more. The result of my analysis is summarized in the Excel dashboard snippet presented below.
