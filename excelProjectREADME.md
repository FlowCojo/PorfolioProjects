Bike Sales Analysis
Project Description
In this project, I evaluated the bike sales data to understand different factors that are considered by the customers before making a purchase decision.
For implementing this, I created pivot tables in Excel to understand how different factors such as income, gender, education, marital status, regions, etc. 
are correlated to each other.
Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
