SALESFORCE REQUIREMENTS

The SALESFORCE requirements are as follows:

Prepare a manual introduction of a Lead in Salesforce. Take the Lead through all the steps of
the Lead Management process and then convert it into an Account/Opportunity/Contact.
Associate a value with the created business opportunity and another contact at the Account
level.
Use the demo environment generated during the hackathon. (As you learned in lesson 2 -
Introduction to Salesforce, steps 4,6,7).
Also, use the demo data of a fictitious company (for example: TerraX SRL).
At the end of solving the above requirements, you will need to create a video to present your
